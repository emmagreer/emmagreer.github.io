        <div class="abouttext"><p>I've been practising photography for around 3 years. I was given my first camera at the age of 8 as a christmas present. Wherever I went I always had my camera and took endless amounts of photos. In the past few years I have decided to work on my photography in detail focusing on still life and some photography using a model. My art was shown in the Potocki Paterson gallery at the end of 2016 as part of a student art show. </p></div>
